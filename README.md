if u cant beat them join them, for pc diga for example website.

## Problems

website didnt let me use beautifulsoup and didnt let me parse all the html code because its protected by Cloudfare
if u dont have a vpn Cloudfare may redirect to the captcha. 
(need to study cloudfare.scrapy library later)

## Open driver
used selenium and python 
you have to get the open driver, i use opera so was slightly harder:
get the driver for your browser from [website]: https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/webdriver/driver_requirements/

## Script
had to maxime window in the script otherwise wouldnt let me.
use webdriver modules to get class by name so i can see all the cards
after getting all the cards, checking which ones are not out of stock.
from those automate a click to the xpath of those.

then search the id of the option to buy the card and click. and done, add to your cart.

it runs every 1 sec,2sec ( i know its not really true because it depends on running time but its close enough, next time i use twisted or smt like that)
## things to improve

when i feel like looking to make a discord bot to notify if something was added to a cart.
maybe automate a payment system

## Disclouse

this is for practicing my python skills
dont resell gpus
just buy if you in need. many people are being prevented from purschasing because of imoral idiots like me.

Fist time interacting with html was fun.
